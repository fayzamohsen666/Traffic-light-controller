It supports both Automatic Mode (predefined traffic sequence with countdown) and Manual Mode (user-controlled switching with a button).

--Features

Multiplexed 7-segment display for countdown timers

Automatic and manual traffic modes

LED indicators for Red, Yellow, Green signals

External interrupt for switching between modes

--Tools & Requirements

MikroC (or similar compiler)

Proteus (for simulation)
